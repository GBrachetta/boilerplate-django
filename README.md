# Django Boilerplate

![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/gbrachetta/image/upload/v1607301400/oob_bfglzw.jpg)

This app is a boilerplate with ready-to-go settings for a new Django app.

It assumes using AWS to store static files, and the production variables have been added accordingly (but they only load in case there's a `USE_AWS=True` variable in the environment).

It also assumes deploying in Heroku to make use of their database, but that can be easily changed to any other database set of variables in `your-app-name/settings/production.py`.

## How to get started

1. Download this repository to your computer and open it with your editor.

   The app contains a Pipfile, so a virtual shell will be automatically started if you have [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) installed, otherwise create your virtual environment with the manager of your preference.

2. Install the requirements with `$ pipenv install` and `$ pipenv install --dev` if using Pipenv, otherwise with `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. You can change the name of the project to one of your liking by running

    `$ python manage.py rename <current-project-name> <new-project-name>`

4. Apply migrations with `$ python manage.py migrate` to initialize the database with the proprietary Django models.

That's all. Happy coding!

## Notes

- The `.gitignore` file provided is ready to ignore all the commonly ignored files so if you create a local repository (`$ git init`) it will take care of ignoring sensitive information.

- The `.env` file provided (`your-app-name/settings/.env`) is the place to include your environment variables. Change `DJANGO_ENV` to either `development` or `production` for the corresponding settings to load (default is 'development').

- New settings go in the following files:

  - `your-app-name/settings/common.py` for settings common to both development and production
  - `your-app-name/settings/development.py` for settings used during development.
  - `your-app-name/settings/production.py` for settings used for production.

- The app includes a handy django toolbar (only available in the development environment) that facilitates debugging.

- The app also includes my favorite settings to develop a Django app on VS Code, and a `launch.json` file to run the server in debugging mode using the integrated debugger in VS Code. Feel free to delete these and the parent `.vscode` folder if you use some other editor.

- An additional command has been added, `$ python manage.py makesuper` that creates a superuser in one line:

  - Username: admin
  - Password: admin
  - Email: admin@domain.com
